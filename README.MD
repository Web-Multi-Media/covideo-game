# CoVideo Game

This repository hosts the code of CoVideo Game, a web browser charades party game sometimes called Time's Up.
It uses Express as a web application framework for the Node.js backend and the React JavaScript library for building the frontend client application.


# Development

## dependencies
For developping you will need to install node dependencies of both the backend and the frontend.
You may want to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install a recent version of *node.js* with a compatible *npm* version.
Move to `backend/` and `frontend/` and install the dependencies by entering:
```
npm install
```

## start dev servers
Start the backend development server by entering from the `backend/` directory:
```
npm run dev
```

Start the fronend development server by entering from the `frontend/` directory:
```
npm start
```

A browser will automatically open and load the application served at http://localhost:3000/.
